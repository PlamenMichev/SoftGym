                        Our smart system generates you a eating plan for a particular time span. It consists of meals devided
                        into 4 categories - Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner and Snack. You will have different foods generated by our
                        system with their weight and total calories. You will have three options for every food so your eating
                        style will be diverse. You will have 5 meals per day and 2 of them will be snacks so you will have 6 snacks
                        to choose from. If you give correct information to our system it will generate you a perfect eating plan
                        which will help you achieve your goal.
